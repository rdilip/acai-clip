# acai-CLIP

acai (all contrastive advances/improvements) CLIP is CLIP on steroids. I'm implementing every experimental add-on that I can find and that seems to generalize well. I think there's a lot of opportunities for contrastive learning applications in biology but the small data sizes are holding us back, so anything we can do to improve that will be beneficial.
